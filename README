# latex-packages

This repository contains LaTeX packages I created to abstract some
recurring typing away.

License information as well as documentation is contained in all files.
Please cat them to learn about these things.

However, these packages may not be written cleanly or cleverly, because
they are only hacks, and first attempts. So, they may break some things.

Then again, I use these packges with the TeXLive distro from Debian Sid,
but my ~/texmf overrides an absurdly high number of packages, so here
too things may go wrong.
